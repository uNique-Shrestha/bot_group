# tgbot
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved into becoming a basis for modular
bots aiming to provide simple plugin expansion via a simple drag and drop.

Can be found on telegram as [uNiqueko_bot](https://t.me/uNiqueko_bot).
